**Bandurria is a self-hosted lightweight comment system for static websites and blogs. Built in Rust, it consumes only 2MB of RAM. Can be included with a single line of JavaScript (5KB!).**

This project has been started after I used another similar comment system on my [personal blog](https://valeriansaliou.name/blog/), named [Schnack](https://schnack.cool), that requires users to authenticate through OAuth (eg. via Google) before they can send their comment. I have noticed that requiring to OAuth to a Google or GitHub account to send a comment on a random blog (where user trust is possibly low), might discourage a lot of people from commenting. Bandurria comes as a lighter and even simpler alternative to Schnack (without the memory overhead of NodeJS and installing NPM dependencies).

_Tested at Rust version: `rustc 1.84.0 (9fc6b4312 2025-01-07)`_

**ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡± Crafted in Santiago, Chile.**

**ðŸ‘‰ See a live demo of Bandurria on my [personal blog](https://valeriansaliou.name/blog/3d-printing-formlabs-enclosure-project/#comments) (Bandurria is included at the end of the article).**

## Features

* **Built-in spam control** with Proof of Work anti-bot system and Magic Link verifications over email
* **Email-based notifications** and comment moderation (no complex Web admin UI)
* **Zero-dependencies server runtime** and **lightweight JavaScript script**
* **Compatible with any static website** or blog system (as long as your can add 1 line of JavaScript)
* **Customize it in a few lines of CSS** to match your website or blog style

Bandurria provides no administration interface. It solely relies on email notifications for moderation and Magic Links for identity verification. It also does not provide any CSS preset, only CSS classes in its injected HTML that you can freely style to match your blog or website style.

Spam is prevented by requiring user browsers to submit the result to a Proof of Work challenge (based on an improved variant of Hashcash), while the user is typing their comment. This spam prevention method is CAPTCHA-free and hassle-free, since the proof will already be computed when the user will be ready to submit their comment. Upon submission of their comment, the user will receive a Magic Link over email they will need to click on to confirm their identity and submit their comment. Then, you (the administrator) will receive the user comment over email for moderation. If the user has already sent approved comments in the past under the same email, then their comment will be auto-approved. If not, you will need to approve the comment which will also trust the user. Either way, Bandurria notifies people of new replies to their comments over email.

**Oh and what about that name?!** Well, the Bandurria name refers to the _Bandurria Austral_ ([Black-faced Ibis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-faced_ibis)), which is a bird that can be found across Patagonia. It emits interesting [metallic sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5iLNFumfFM).

## ðŸš§ Work In Progress

All features might not have yet been implemented, but this is what Bandurria aims for:

- [x] No social auth, no admin interface, no multiple notification channels, do it all over email notifications with magic links.
- [x] Public users can write their comment, give a name and email and submit in a simple way (WordPress like).
- [x] Once an user first comment got approved then all further comments will be auto approved (unless the user gets banned by the admin).
- [x] Built in theme is to be generic and simple with no colors, it can be extended by the user by styling CSS classes in their own blog theme (CSS class names should be stable, and never use important rules).
- [x] Built with Rust, goal is to produce a 2MB binary using the same amount of RAM and distribute lightweight Docker images for all platforms.
- [x] Format URLs into clickable links and make comments anchorable when clicking on the comment date.
- [x] Admin users can manage comments and remove or allow them from their email inbox using magic links.
- [x] Notify admin of new comments over email.
- [ ] Proof of work anti spam mechanism, with progress bar (multiple parallel hash computation), with ability to configure difficulty.
- [ ] Upon sending a comment and passing the PoW, always require administrators to moderate the comment, even if it comes from an administrator email (no-fault spam prevention).
- [ ] Notify of replies to user comments over email to users if they opted to receive replies once the comment passed moderation (enable engagement, which was an issue with other simple commenting systems since users didnâ€™t get notified of replies to their own comments).
- [ ] Upon sending the first comment for a given page, internally check that the blog page exists with a HTTP request (it should return 200), if the page already exists in database then no need to check again (this prevents inserting junk in the database).
- [ ] Provide ability to customize every action, button and input placeholder wordings, since there will be no internationalization, it will solely be done via configuring custom eg. button labels from the configuration file.
- [ ] Verify origin of comments to be from the same domain as the site, and also prevent CORS (for security and anti-spam reasons).

## How to use it?

### Installation

**Install from Docker Hub:**

You might find it convenient to run Bandurria via Docker. You can find the pre-built Bandurria image on Docker Hub as [valeriansaliou/bandurria](https://hub.docker.com/r/valeriansaliou/bandurria/).

First, pull the `valeriansaliou/bandurria` image:

```bash
docker pull valeriansaliou/bandurria:v0.2.0
```

Then, provide a configuration file and run it (replace `/path/to/your/bandurria/config.cfg` with the path to your configuration file):

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/your/bandurria/config.cfg:/etc/bandurria.cfg valeriansaliou/bandurria:v0.2.0
```

In the configuration file, ensure that:

* `server.inet` is set to `0.0.0.0:8080` (this lets Bandurria be reached from outside the container)
* `assets.path` is set to `./res/assets/` (this refers to an internal path in the container, as the assets are contained there)

Bandurria will be reachable from `http://localhost:8080`.

**Install from binary:**

A pre-built binary of Bandurria is shared in the releases on GitHub. You can simply download the latest binary version from the [releases page](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/releases), and run it on your server.

You will still need to provide the binary with the configuration file, so make sure you have a Bandurria `config.cfg` file ready somewhere.

_The binary provided is statically-linked, which means that it will be able to run on any Linux-based server. Still, it will not work on MacOS or Windows machines._

ðŸ‘‰ _Each release binary comes with an `.asc` signature file, which can be verified using [@valeriansaliou](https://github.com/valeriansaliou) GPG public key: [:key:valeriansaliou.gpg.pub.asc](https://valeriansaliou.name/files/keys/valeriansaliou.gpg.pub.asc)._

**Install from Cargo:**

If you prefer managing `bandurria` via Rust's Cargo, install it directly via `cargo install`:

```bash
cargo install bandurria
```

Ensure that your `$PATH` is properly configured to source the Crates binaries, and then run Bandurria using the `bandurria` command.

**Install from source:**

The last option is to pull the source code from Git and compile Bandurria via `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

You can find the built binaries in the `./target/release` directory.

### Configuration

Use the sample [config.cfg](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/blob/master/config.cfg) configuration file and adjust it to your own environment.

You can also use environment variables with string interpolation in your configuration file, eg. `server.inet = ${BANDURRIA_INET}`.

**Available configuration options are commented below, with allowed values:**

**[server]**

* `log_level` (type: _string_, allowed: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, default: `error`) â€” Verbosity of logging, set it to `error` in production
* `inet` (type: _string_, allowed: IPv4 / IPv6 + port, default: `[::1]:8080`) â€” Host and TCP port the Bandurria server should listen on

**[assets]**

* `path` (type: _string_, allowed: UNIX path, default: `./res/assets/`) â€” Path to Bandurria assets directory

**[database]**

**[database.mysql]**

* `uri` (type: _string_, allowed: MySQL connection URI, no default) â€” MySQL URI (ie. `mysql://user:password@server:port/database`)

**[email]**

* `server_port` (type: _integer_, allowed: TCP port, default: `587`) â€” SMTP TCP port to connect to
* `server_starttls` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `true`) â€” Whether to encrypt SMTP connection with `STARTTLS` or not
* `server_tls` (type: _boolean_, allowed: `true`, `false`, default: `false`) â€” Whether to encrypt SMTP connection with `TLS` or not
* `auth_user` (type: _string_, allowed: any string, default: no default) â€” SMTP username to use for authentication (if any)
* `auth_password` (type: _string_, allowed: any string, default: no default) â€” SMTP password to use for authentication (if any)

**[email.identity]**

* `from_name` (type: _string_, allowed: any string, default: `Comments`) â€” Name to send the emails from
* `from_email` (type: _string_, allowed: email address, default: no default) â€” Email to send the emails from

**[site]**

* `name` (type: _string_, allowed: any string, default: no default) â€” Name of the site
* `admin_emails` (type: _array[string]_, allowed: email addresses, default: no default) â€” Email addresses of site administrators
* `site_url` (type: _string_, allowed: URL, default: no default) â€” URL of the site
* `comments_url` (type: _string_, allowed: URL, default: no default) â€” URL of the comment system

**[security]**

* `secret_key` (type: _string_, allowed: any hexadecimal string, default: auto-generated secret) â€” Secret key to use to sign all authenticated payloads (generate yours with `openssl rand -hex 32`)

### Run Bandurria

#### 1. Create the SQL database

Before you can run Bandurria, you need to create its SQL database in MySQL:

1. Create your MySQL database: `CREATE DATABASE bandurria CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;`
2. Import the [MySQL database schema](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/blob/master/doc/fixtures/bandurria.sql)
3. Adjust the Bandurria configuration file so that the configuration value at `database.mysql.uri` points to your MySQL database

#### 2. Start Bandurria

When you are ready, you can start Bandurria as such:

`./bandurria -c /path/to/bandurria/config.cfg`

If you use Docker, refer to the Docker instructions above ("_Install from Docker Hub_").

#### 3. Include Bandurria on your site

Now that Bandurria is running, we can include the script on our website!

**First, create the HTML container where your comments will be injected by Bandurria:**

```html
<!-- Your blog article is right before that -->

<aside id="comments" class="post-comments"></aside>
```

This container is usually placed at the end of blog articles (if you are including Bandurria on a blog).

**Then, add the Bandurria loader script right before the `</body>` closing tag:**

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <!-- The rest of your body goes here -->

        <script
            src="/bandurria/assets/embed.js"
            data-bandurria-target=".post-comments"
        ></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

We are assuming here that Bandurria is running over a reverse proxy such as NGINX, proxying the `/bandurria/` path to Bandurria's root.

**Finally, in your `<head>` section, include Bandurria's style, which you may customize to fit your own design:**

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <!-- The rest of your head goes here -->

        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/path/to/your/own/bandurria.css" />
    </head>
</html>
```

You may copy and paste the example [bandurria.css](https://github.com/valeriansaliou/bandurria/blob/master/res/assets/dev/test-page/bandurria.css) file that we provide, and start from there.
